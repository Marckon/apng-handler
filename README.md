# apng-handler
decode and encode (a)png in modern browser environment 🌐. Including：

1. （decode）get png frames from apng buffer
2. （encode）assemble png buffers to apng buffer

## Intro
We have already used a great library -- [apng-canvas](https://github.com/davidmz/apng-canvas) in our production environment. It gives you ability to control apng playing behavior. Generally, I spend most of my time on normal logic codes. I hardly get the chance to know blob, buffer and bitwise operation while this lib has few annotation. We need more references to know more about`(a)png`. I learned this lib and add lots of annotation to it.

Additionally, I wrote a snippet of assemble apng buffer from png buffers, which runs in browser environment.

## Usage

> Currently this package doesn't offer enough abilities. But I still publish it to npm, in case that you want to try it out.

### Install

-  install as a node_module

```bash
npm install apng-handler --save
```

- use cdn 
```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/apng-handler@{{version}}/dist/index.js"></script>
```

### demo

```typescript
// window.ApngHandler
import { apngDecoder, apngAssembler } from 'apng-handler';

const appendImg = (buf: ArrayBuffer) => {
  const img = document.createElement('img');
  img.width = 100;
  const url = URL.createObjectURL(
    new Blob([new Uint8Array(buf)], { type: 'image/apng' })
  );
  img.src = url;
  document.body.appendChild(img);
};

const blob = apngAssembler({
  buffers: [],// image buffers
  width: 302,
  height: 192,
});

blob.arrayBuffer().then((buf) => {
  appendImg(buf);
  apngDecoder(buf).then((blobs) => {
    blobs.forEach((b) => {
      b.arrayBuffer().then((_b) => {
        appendImg(_b);
      });
    });
  });
});
    
```

# Tail

💓 Plz feel free to make pr to add more functions of handling apng like compressing, clipping and coloring, etc.
